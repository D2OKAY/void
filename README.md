Void is the open-source Cursor alternative.

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. Void sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full sourcecode for Void. If you're new, welcome!

## Features

### 🤖 CrewAI Multi-Agent Coding Mode
Void now includes a CrewAI-inspired multi-agent coding system that orchestrates specialized AI agents to handle complex coding tasks:

- **🔍 Researcher**: Analyzes codebases and understands project structure
- **💻 Developer**: Creates and edits code
- **✅ Reviewer**: Reviews changes for quality and best practices
- **🧪 Tester**: Suggests and validates tests
- **📝 Documenter**: Creates clear documentation

Select "CrewAI (Coding)" from the chat mode dropdown to use this feature. See [docs/crewai/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](docs/crewai/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) for details.

### Other Features
- 🤖 Use AI agents on your codebase
- 📸 Checkpoint and visualize changes
- 🏠 Bring any model or host locally
- 🔒 Direct provider integration (no data retention)
